extends MultiplayerSynchronizer
class_name SceneSafeMpSynchronizer
## Handshakes with remote synchronizers before allowing data to flow between remote peers.


## This is an extended version of the MultiplayerSynchronizer that interfaces with the
## SceneSafeMpManager to ensure that all peers have actually instantiated their respective
## synchronizers before beginning to send data to them. This prevents dreaded "Node not found"
## errors from clogging up the data flow and preventing synchronizers from functioning when users
## change scenes.

## NOTE: When using this node, you MUST NOT set the public_visibility property. If you need to
## change the public visibility after handshaking is completed, you MUST use the 
## set_public_visibility method. Directly setting the property will break this node and the
## guarantees that the handshaking system provides.

## Controls whether this synchronizer is used to share authority with, and control spawns from a 
## SceneSafeMpSpawner node. If true, then this Synchronizer's visibility will be controlled by the 
## authority to manage node spawns between connected peers. One, and only one synchronizer should
## be marked as a spawner visibility controller
@export var is_spawner_visibility_controller: bool = false;

## This is a list of the peers that have confirmed the existence of this synchronizer.
## These peers are safe to send data to, and only make sense from the perspective of the authority
## of this synchronizer.
var _internal_handshake_visibility: Array = [];

## This is a separate visibility map so that we don't clobber existing visibility entirely,
## we want to be able to support both at once: Handshake visibility as well as normal visibility.
var _internal_visibility_map: Dictionary = {};

## This is used internally to store whether the synchronizer should be public once the handshaking
## is completed.
var _internal_public_visibility: bool;

## This is used in conjunction with the spawner visibility controller variable to link this
## synchronizer with the parent spawner that should be controlling it.
var _parent_spawner: SceneSafeMpSpawner;

## Note: It is not possible to re-define a public property so we can't do anything like the below
## to clean up the usage of the public visible property.
